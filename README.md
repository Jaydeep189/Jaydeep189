## About Me

I was brought up in a small town in Gujarat India, studied in Vadodara, building systems for people around the world. <br/>
I like reading, because it helps me understand the world better. <br/>
I like sports because it teachs me teamwork. <br/>
I like meditation because it made me realize how slow life actually is. <br/>

That's enough information on a github profile about me I guess.
